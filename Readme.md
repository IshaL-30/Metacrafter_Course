# Project Title
ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course & ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course

## Simple overview of use/purpose.
These courses are designed to provide a foundational understanding of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and intermediate-level knowledge combining Ethereum and Avalanche ecosystems. The beginner course focuses on the basics of EVM, while the intermediate course delves deeper into integrating both Ethereum and Avalanche networks.

## Description
The ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course introduces learners to the fundamentals of the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts, and the EVM. It covers essential concepts such as blockchain architecture, Ethereum transactions, and deploying basic smart contracts. The ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course builds on this foundation, exploring more advanced topics including cross-chain interactions, deploying and managing smart contracts on both Ethereum and Avalanche, and leveraging the unique features of each network. These courses aim to equip learners with the skills needed to develop, deploy, and manage decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum and Avalanche.

## Getting Started

### Installing
1. **Clone the repository:**
   \\`sh
   git clone https://github.com/metacrafters/evm-courses.git
   \\`

2. **Navigate to the course directory:**
   \\`sh
   cd evm-courses
   \\`

3. **Install dependencies:**
   \\`sh
   npm install
   \\`

### Executing program
1. **Start the development server:**
   \\`sh
   npm start
   \\`

2. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   \\`sh
   http://localhost:3000
   \\`

3. **Follow the course instructions provided in the web application.**

### Help
For common problems or issues, consult the following:

- **MetaMask Integration Issues:**
  Ensure that MetaMask is installed and properly configured. Check network settings and account connections.
  
- **Smart Contract Deployment Errors:**
  Verify your smart contract code and make sure the correct network is selected. Check for sufficient gas and correct contract parameters.
  
- **Cross-Chain Interaction Problems:**
  Ensure that both Ethereum and Avalanche networks are properly configured. Verify contract addresses and network IDs.

For additional help, run:
\\`sh
npm run help
\\`
